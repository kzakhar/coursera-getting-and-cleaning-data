# Intro
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example 
[this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the [site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) where the data was obtained.
[Here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) are the data for the project.

# Overview
The script `run_analysis.R` uses the provided open data for wearable computing to create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
For more details see the `CodeBook.md` and the code comments in the `run_analysis.R`.
